## Overview


Stringy is a swiss army knife of string manipulation methods. 

It is designed to be used across a spectrum of applications where text processing is key. Web developers can utilize it to dynamically format user-generated content for display, ensuring consistency across blog posts, comments, and user profiles. In e-commerce, Stringy helps tailor product descriptions, optimizing them for SEO and readability. It's also a boon for data analysts cleansing datasets, easily trimming whitespace, and standardizing case formats.

## Installation

Install \_S and watch your strings do backflips:

```bash
npm install _S
````

Or if you're more of a yarn person:

```bash
yarn add _S
```

## Usage 

### Extract Numbers from a String

Got numbers hiding in your text? We'll find them. It's like hide and seek, but with digits.

```javascript
import { extractNumbers } from "_S";

const text = "Order 500 units of item 1234.";
const numbers = extractNumbers(text); // Found them! [500, 1234]
```

### Check for Balanced Brackets

Ever wonder if your brackets are socially balanced? Let's find out together.

```javascript
import { isBalancedBrackets } from "_S";

const validString = "(Hello [World])";
const isValid = isBalancedBrackets(validString); // True, these brackets are in harmony
```

### Masking Sensitive Id's

Give your id's a subtle disguise. You choose the disguise.
We cover emails, phones, and cards!

```javascript
const email = "user@example.com";
const maskedEmail = maskEmail(email, "*"); // Use '*' for disguise
const dashedEmail = maskEmail(email, "-"); // Use '-' for disguise

console.log(maskedEmail); // 'u***@e******.com'
console.log(dashedEmail); // 'u---@e------.com'
```

### Moderate Content

Ensure your text stays in the safe zone with moderate. This function is like the diligent editor of your strings, replacing those not-so-appropriate words with a mask of your choice, ensuring every sentence is audience-friendly.

```javascript
import { moderate } from "_S";

const originalText = "Stringy is awesome but some words need moderation.";
const wordsToCensor = ["awesome", "moderation"];
const safeText = moderate(originalText, wordsToCensor, "*");

console.log(safeText); // 'Stringy is a****** but some words need m*********.'
```

### Turn into a Title

Give your text the royal treatment – each word's first letter ascends to its uppercase throne.

```javascript
import { toTitleCase } from "_S";

const humbleText = "i am stringy";
const titled = toTitleCase(humbleText); // "I Am Stringy"
```

### Trim Whitespace

Give your string a neat trim, because everyone loves a well-groomed text.

```javascript
import { trimWhitespace } from "_S";

const messy = "  Too much space?   ";
const neat = trimWhitespace(messy); // "Too much space?"
```

### Word Wrapper

Wrap your text neatly with wordWrap, the function that ensures your strings never spill out of their bounds. Ideal for crafting perfectly formatted paragraphs, be it in a console, an article, or anywhere text needs to stay within the lines.

```javascript
const longText =
  "This is a long string that needs to be wrapped at a specific width.";
const wrappedText = wordWrap(longText, 20);

console.log(wrappedText);
// Output:
// This is a long
// string that needs
// to be wrapped at a
// specific width.
```

### Shorten

trims your string to the desired length and tastefully tops it off with an ellipsis (...) and a custom ending, hinting there's more for the eager reader.

```javascript
import { shorten } from "_S";

const blog =
  "Meet Stringy, the latest JavaScript library designed to revolutionize how we handle strings. Whether you're a seasoned developer";
const shortened = shorten(blog, 40, "Read More");
// "Meet Stringy, the latest JavaScript library designed to ...Read More"
```

### String Scatter

Mix it up! Randomize the characters in your string for a bit of fun or some serious unscrambling challenges.

```javascript
import { shuffleString } from "_S";

const word = "Randomize";
const jumbled = shuffleString(word); // Example: "mnaodRzi"
```

### Hunt a Word

a treasure hunt in your strings, where you discover the hidden indices of your sought-after substrings.

```javascript
import { findPositions } from "_S";

const narrative = "Echoes in the echoes in the echoes";
const echoLocations = findPositions(narrative, "echoes"); // [0, 14, 28]
```

### Number Makeover

Spruce up your digits with formatNumber – it's like a spa day for your numbers, turning them from plain to absolutely fabulous, all dressed up with commas and style.

```javascript
import { formatNumber } from "_S";

const largeNumber = 1234567;
const beautifiedNumber = formatNumber(largeNumber); // "1,234,567"
```

### Time Makeover

Step into the time machine with formatDateTime. Transform dates and times from mundane to meaningful, showcasing them in a format that speaks to humans, not just machines.

```javascript
import { formatDateTime } from "_S";

const eventTimestamp = new Date("2023-07-21T19:30:00");
const formattedDateTime = formatDateTime(eventTimestamp); // "July 21, 2023, 7:30 PM"
```

### Bracket Balancer

Navigate the tightrope of syntax with isBalancedBrackets. It's like a gymnast gracefully ensuring every leap has a landing – every open bracket finds its closing match.

```javascript
import { isBalancedBrackets } from "_S";

const codeSnippet = "{[()]}";
const isBalanced = isBalancedBrackets(codeSnippet); // true
```

### The Levenshtein Distance

Measure the steps between strings with levenshteinDistance. It's like having a pedometer for your text, counting the edits required to transition from one string to another.

```javascript
import { levenshteinDistance } from "_S";

const stringA = "kitten";
const stringB = "sitting";
const editDistance = levenshteinDistance(stringA, stringB); // 3
```
